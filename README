Numeric Javascript by Sébastien Loisel
======================================

Numeric Javascript is a javascript library for doing numerical analysis in
the browser. Because Numeric Javascript uses only the javascript programming
language, it works in many browsers and does not require powerful servers.

Numeric Javascript is for building "web 2.0" apps that can perform complex
calculations in the browser and thus avoid the latency of asking a server
to compute something. Indeed, you do not need a powerful server (or any
server at all) since your web app will perform all its calculations in the
client.
